# Milestone 2 - Animations, Extension and Enemies 

This developer update will describe the second milestone in the development of Labyrinth Legends.

## Goals
The main goal of this milestone is to extend the already implemented functionality of the game, as well as introduce Enemies as a factor in the game as well.

The main goals for this milestone is:
- To implement different types of collectibles, each giving a different amount of points when collected.
- To implement enemies to the game, for the player to either avoid or attack (for extra points)
    - As a sub-goal of this, the player character is going to have a pool of health available.
- Animations (and "final" sprite-design for the player character, enemies and collectibles)


### Progress:
- To implement different types of collectibles, each giving a different amount of points when collected.
    - Get this back to a working state.
    
- To implement AI-controlled enemies to the game, for the player to either avoid or attack (for extra points)
    - As a sub-goal of this, the player character is going to have a pool of health available.

        - Figure out health-implementation
        - Make enemies do different amount of damage and have different amounts of health
        - attack stuff - not implemented
- Animations (and "final" sprite-design for the player character, enemies and collectibles)
    - Done? Need death animation and trigger + enemies!
    - Collectible particles would be nice
